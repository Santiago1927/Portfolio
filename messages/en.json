      "content": "React has evolved significantly in recent years. In this article we explore current best practices for developing modern applications with React.\n\n1. Use Hooks Effectively\nHooks have revolutionized the way we write React components. useState and useEffect are fundamental, but hooks like useMemo and useCallback can significantly optimize performance.\n\n2. Small and Focused Components\nKeep your components small and with a single responsibility. This makes your code easier to test and maintain.\n\n3. TypeScript for Greater Safety\nTypeScript helps you catch errors at development time and makes your code more robust.\n\n4. Server Components with Next.js\nReact Server Components allow rendering components on the server, significantly improving performance."

      "title": "Next.js Performance Optimization",

      "content": "Next.js offers multiple tools to optimize the performance of your web applications. Here are the most effective techniques.\n\n1. Image Optimization\nUse the next/image component for automatic image optimization. It supports lazy loading, modern formats like WebP, and responsive images.\n\n2. Intelligent Code Splitting\nNext.js automatically splits your code, but you can optimize it further using dynamic imports for heavy components.\n\n3. Server-Side Rendering and Static Generation\nChoose the right strategy: SSR for dynamic content, SSG for static content, and ISR for the best of both worlds.\n\n4. Caching and Revalidation\nImplement intelligent caching strategies using HTTP headers and Next.js revalidation API."

      "content": "TypeScript has become the standard for professional JavaScript projects. Here are some tips for using it effectively.\n\n1. Generic Types\nGeneric types allow you to create reusable components and functions with complete type safety.\n\n2. Utility Types\nTypeScript includes utility types like Partial, Pick, Omit, and Record that simplify type manipulation.\n\n3. Type Guards\nUse type guards to refine types at runtime and improve TypeScript's inference.\n\n4. Strict Configuration\nEnable strict mode in tsconfig.json to catch more potential errors.\n\n5. Interfaces vs Types\nWhen to use interfaces and when to use types. Generally, interfaces for objects that can be extended, types for unions and intersections."
